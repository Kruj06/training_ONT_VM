# App TrainingONT: Biosphere BASE environment for the cours "Introduction to Minion data analysis for viral metagenome"

## Description

Methods for sequencing complete genomes such as microorganisms, plant, including pathogens, are evolving with so-called "third generation sequencing" methods. In particular, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) offers small-sized sequencers equipment that allow for easy use in several research laboratories, especially in the African developing countries.  This booming technology makes it possible to meet the high demand for sequencing, in many fields: medical, environmental, animal, plant...

Universit√© Joseph Ki-Zerbo and its partners (LMI Patho Bios, CIRAD, IRD, INERA) are organising this training for scientists and students from West Africa. This training will enable them to take advantage of these new technologies to meet the challenges they face on pathogen issues.

In this cours, we want to know how diverse the pineapple metavirome is. For that we will use taxonomic assignment of nanopore reads and assembly methods.

This cours will be done using Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. IFB cloud appliance provides both the Jupyter Notebook and Lab environment (see [explanations](https://jupyter.org/index.html)).
